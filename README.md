 - ### Micro Projects: 

	- __Python__
		- [ML with Logistic Regression](https://github.com/Ravikeethi/Data-Specialist/blob/main/Machine%20Learning%20Basic%20Algorthims/Machine%20Learning%20with%20Logistic%20Regression.ipynb): Using Logistic Regression to predict whether an internet user clicked an ad or not.
		- [ML with K Nearest Neighbours](https://github.com/Ravikeethi/Data-Specialist/blob/main/Machine%20Learning%20Basic%20Algorthims/ML%20with%20K%20Nearest%20Neighbors.ipynb): Using KNN to classify instances from a fake dataset into two target classes, while choosing the best value for K using the elbow method.
		- [ML with Decision Trees and Random Forests](https://github.com/Ravikeethi/Data-Specialist/blob/main/Machine%20Learning%20Basic%20Algorthims/Machine%20Learning%20with%20Decision%20Trees%20and%20Random%20Forests.ipynb): Using Decision Trees and Random Forests to predict whether a lender will pay their loan back. Uses publically available data from LendingClub.com
